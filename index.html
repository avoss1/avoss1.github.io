                <p>Hi, my name is Andrew and I'm currently a mechanical engineer at <a href="https://www.tptechcorp.com/" target="_blank">Transport Phenomena Technologies</a>.
                I graduated from Tufts University in May 2022 with my B.S. in mechanical engineering. While at Tufts, I was a member the electric racing team, climbing team, and Tufts Mountain Club.
                </p>
                <p>I'm excited about electromechanical systems, data acquisition, and teaching myself how to keep all ten (nine?) fingers in the machine shop. Some fun things I've worked on at my current job
                    are: a repurposed laser engraver that traverses samples of aerogels to generate a depth map, reprogramming a furnace controller to include a GUI and live graphing of temperature conditions,
                    and custom machined parts for each of these (and other projects).
                </p>
                <p>Other stuff I've made usually relies on 3D printing (given its ease and affordability), like towel hooks that cost less than a quarter to make, a phone holder for my road bike, and even this website!
                    In progress, I have a ROV that is currently in its figuring-out-where-all-the-leaks-are phase. As of now (January 2023), that is challenging given seasonal conditions.
                    You can find more information on stuff I've done on the projects page, or go directly to a project from the dropdown menu.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of professionally breaking stuff, I enjoy hiking, biking, skiing, and rock climbing––an inexaustive list.</p>
