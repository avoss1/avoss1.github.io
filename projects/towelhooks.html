                <p class="descR">Summer 2021 saw me subleasing a small room in Medford, MA so I could intern with the Massachusetts DOT. I couldn't attach hooks to the doors or walls (and I didn't want to buy any of the hanging implements anyway).</p>

                    So, I measured the width of the top of the door to see if I could make something that could hang from the top. Using this measurement, I designed a hook that would fit over a door and was not too ugly.<br>
                    The first iteration was a simple J shape and deformed too much. My next iteration, see left, fixed this design flaw and has been successful at holding wet (and dry) towels for the many months since I printed it.<br>
