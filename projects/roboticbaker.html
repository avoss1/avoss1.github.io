            <p class="descR">The final project for my robotics class was a daunting task: as a class, we had to build a robot that would take cake ingredients and turn it into a baked and frosted cake entirely autonomously. (As if that weren't enough, it had to frost a picture that we would only get to see the day of the demonstration).<br>
                I joined the mixing team because my initial team (oven control) ended up with too many people. Our task was to take the liquid and dry ingredients for a cake and mix them into batter before depositing it into a pan for baking.</p>
