            <h2 class="title">3D Printed Phone Mount</h2>
            <p class="descL">My road bike was shipped across the country to me since I will be spending the summer in Medford and wanted a physical activity to do locally. Unfortunately for me, my parents did not include the GPS unit I had been using to record my rides at home.<br>
                In the limited time I rode my bike so far in Massachusetts, I placed my phone in the back pocket of my cycling jersey. However, I often slack off on how much I exert myself if I cannot see numbers to quantify my effort somehow.<br>
                Since all the metrics I wanted were visible on my phone, I looked on Thingiverse to see if I could print a cradle for my phone to mount on my handlebars as an ad hoc bike computer. While I found many variations of printed enclosures, no designs existed that fit an iPhone X.<br>
                The closest (and most uncomplicated) design I chose to imitate looks very similar to the attached photos.<br>
                I designed the cradle to be printed in two pieces so I wouldn't have to worry about adding supports to the print which saved material. The pieces slot together and are held together tightly when attached to bike handlebars.</p>
