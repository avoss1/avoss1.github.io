            <h2 class="title">iRobot Revamp</h2>
            <p class="descL">What if you could feel like you were home, no matter where you were? My senior mechanical engineering design group is expanding the existing iRobot Create's capabilities to include telerobotic functionality. 
                Improvements will allow users to see their homes virtually and allow them to interact with their homes from the robot. <br>The most obvious challenge is how to get a robot that exists to be as unintrusive as possible to be able to interact with surroundings designed for people (creatures much taller than your average Roomba).<br>
            <br>With these thoughts in mind, our task was to design modifications that allowed the robot to interact with the world while allowing its user to remotely control it.<br>
            <br>The design process started with rough sketches to ideate the various ways we could accomplish our goals.<br></p>

            <p class="descR">After creating an improved sketch, we each chose one to CAD and present to our sponsor from iRobot. I decided to model a scissor lift. (Because we decided it would require very tight tolerances to be as extendable as it need to be, it was an obvious no moving forward.)
            To the left is an animation of the scissor lift mechanism that would move the platform holding the camera and an arm up and down.</p>
